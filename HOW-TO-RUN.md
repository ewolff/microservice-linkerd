# How to Run

This is a step-by-step guide how to run the example:

## Installation Minikube

* Install
[minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases). Minikube
is a Kubernetes environment in a virtual machine that is easy to use
and install. It is not meant for production but to test Kubernetes or
for developer environments.

* Create a Minikube instance with `minikube start --cpus=2 --memory=5000`. This
  will set the memory of the Kubernetes VM to 6.000 MB - which should
  be enough for most experiments. You might want to adjust the number of CPUs
  depending on your local machine. Please make sure that you deleted any pre-existing 
  minikube instance using `minikube delete` as the memory and cpu values would otherwise have no effect. 

```
[~/microservice-linkerd]minikube start --cpus=2 --memory=5000
Starting local Kubernetes v1.12.4 cluster...
Starting VM...
Getting VM IP address...
Moving files into cluster...
Setting up certs...
Connecting to cluster...
Setting up kubeconfig...
Starting cluster components...
Kubectl is now configured to use the cluster.
```

* Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/kubectl/install/). This
  is the command line interface for Kubernetes.

## Installation Google Cloud

* Register for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

* Go to the [Kubernetes Engine Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/kubernetes)

* Create or select a project for this demo.

Note: You can do the installation and all other steps in the [Google
Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/). The Google Cloud
Shell provides access to a Linux system. That way there is no need to
install any software on the local machine, just a modern web browser
is enough.

Otherwise you need to install the [Google Cloud
SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) and
[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/kubectl/install/).

* Select the project from the Kubernetes Engine Page with `gcloud
  config set project <project name>`

* Choose a data center e.g. in Frankfurt `gcloud config set
  compute/zone europe-west3-a`
  
* Define the `PROJECT_ID` by doing `export PROJECT_ID="$(gcloud config
  get-value project -q)"`
  
* Configure Docker `gcloud auth configure-docker`

* Create a cluster with `gcloud container clusters create
  hello-cluster --num-nodes=3 --release-channel=rapid`
  
## Install Linkerd

This and all following steps are either done in the command line
(Minikube / Google Cloud) or the Google Cloud Shell.

* [Install](https://linkerd.io/2/getting-started/) Linkerd. 
* Check that the Linkerd install was successful: `linkerd check`

## Add Linkerd Proxies

To use Linkerd, all network traffic must go through a proxy. These
proxies are injected if the namespace is annotated accordingly. Use
this command:

```
kubectl annotate namespace default linkerd.io/inject=enabled
```

## Install Traefik Ingress Controller

To access the microservices, you must install an Traefik Ingress
Controller.  The [Traefik Installation
Guide](https://docs.traefik.io/getting-started/install-traefik/)
explains this in detail. For Kubernetes the [installation using
Helm](https://docs.traefik.io/getting-started/install-traefik/#use-the-helm-chart)
might be the best option.  Traefik will listen on port 80 unless you
changed the port by modifying the value for `ports.web.exposedPort` like
so: `helm install --set ports.web.exposedPort=81 --namespace=traefik traefik traefik/traefik`

## Compile Java Code

This step is optional. You can skip this part and
proceed to "Run the Containers".

* The example is implemented in Java. See
   https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml about how
   to download Java. The
   examples need to be compiled so you need to install a JDK (Java
   Development Kit). A JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is not
   sufficient. After the installation you should be able to execute
   `java` and `javac` on the command line.
   You need at least Java 11. In the Google Cloud Shell, use `sudo
   update-java-alternatives -s java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64 && export
   JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64` to select Java 11.

* The example run in Docker Containers. You need to install Docker
  Community Edition, see https://www.docker.com/community-edition/
  . You should be able to run `docker` after the installation.

Change to the directory `microservice-linkerd-demo` and run `./mvnw clean
package` (macOS / Linux) or `mvnw.cmd clean package` (Windows). This will take a while:

```
[~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo]./mvnw clean package
....

```

If this does not work:

* Ensure that `settings.xml` in the directory `.m2` in your home
directory contains no configuration for a specific Maven repo. If in
doubt: delete the file.

* The tests use some ports on the local machine. Make sure that no
server runs in the background.

* Skip the tests: `./mvnw clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true` or
  `mvnw.cmd clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true` (Windows).

* In rare cases dependencies might not be downloaded correctly. In
  that case: Remove the directory `repository` in the directory `.m2`
  in your home directory. Note that this means all dependencies will
  be downloaded again.


## Build Docker Images

Now the Java code has been compiled. The next step is to create Docker
images:

* Minkube only: Configure Docker so that it uses the Kubernetes cluster. This is
required to install the
Docker images: `minikube docker-env`(macOS / Linux) or `minikube.exe docker-env`(Windows) tells you how to do that. 

* Minikube only: Afterwards you should see the Docker images of Kubernetes if you do `docker images`:

```

```

* Run `docker-build.sh` in the directory
`microservice-linkerd-demo`. It builds the Docker images.

```

* Sometime pulling the images does not work. Try `docker logout` then
  and rerun the script.

* The images should now be available:

```
[~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo]docker images
REPOSITORY                                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE

...
```

* Google Cloud only: Upload the images to the Google Cloud with `./docker-push-gcp.sh`


## Run the Containers

* If you have build the Docker images yourself and use Google Cloud: 
  Modify the YAML files to load the Docker images
from the Google Docker repo with `fix-microservices-gcp.sh`
* If you haven't built the Docker container yourself, run
  `fix-microservices-dockerhub.sh`. The Docker images will be
  downloaded from the Docker Hub in the Internet then.
* Deploy the infrastructure for the microservices using `kubectl` in
  the directory
  `microservice-kubernetes-demo`.
  Use `infrastructure-gcp.yaml` instead of `infrastructure.yaml` if you
  if you built and uploaded the images to Google Cloud. 
  Use `infrastructure-dockerhub.yaml` if you haven't
  built the Docker container yourself:

```
[~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo]kubectl apply -f infrastructure.yaml
deployment.apps/apache created
deployment.apps/postgres created
service/apache created
service/postgres created
ingress.extensions/apache created
```


* Deploy the microservices using `kubectl`.
  Use `microservices-gcp.yaml` instead of `microservices.yaml` if you
  if you built and uploaded the images to Google Cloud. 
  Use `microservices-dockerhub.yaml` if you haven't
  built the Docker container yourself:

```
[~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo]kubectl apply -f microservices.yaml
deployment.apps/invoicing created
deployment.apps/shipping created
deployment.apps/order created
service/invoicing created
service/shipping created
service/order created
virtualservice.networking.linkerd.io/shipping created
virtualservice.networking.linkerd.io/invoicing created
virtualservice.networking.linkerd.io/order created
```

The script creates Pods based on the Docker images created
before. Pods might
contain one or
many Docker containers. In this case, each Pod contains one
Docker container with the microservice and another one with linkerd
infrastructure is created automatically.

Note: The Postgres installation is very limited i.e. it is not ensured
that data survives restarts or changes in the cluster. However, for a demo
this should be enough and it simplifies the setup.

Also Kubernetes services are created. Services have a clusterwide unique IP
address and a DNS entry. Service can use many Pods to do load
balancing. To actually view the services:

* Run `kubectl get services` to see all services:

```
[~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo]kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
apache       NodePort    10.31.244.219   <none>        80:30798/TCP     29m
invoicing    NodePort    10.31.249.73    <none>        80:32105/TCP     2m34s
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.31.240.1     <none>        443/TCP          80m
order        NodePort    10.31.241.103   <none>        80:30426/TCP     2m33s
postgres     NodePort    10.31.252.0     <none>        5432:31520/TCP   29m
shipping     NodePort    10.31.251.213   <none>        80:31754/TCP     2m34s
```


* Run `kubectl describe service` for more
  details. This also works for pods (`kubectl describe pod`) and
  deployments (`kubectl describe deployment`).

```
[~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo]kubectl describe service order
Name:                     order

Session Affinity:         None
External Traffic Policy:  Cluster
Events:                   <none>kubectl describe services
```

* You can also get a list of the pods:

```
[~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo]kubectl get pods
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
apache-7f7f7f79c6-jbqx8      1/1     Running   0          8m51s

shipping-5d58798cdd-9jqj8    1/1     Running   0          8m43s
```

* ...and you can see the logs of a pod:

```
~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo$ kubectl logs order-cc7f8866-9zbnf order

#
```

## Use the Demo

The demo is available via an Traefik Ingress that provides access to all the
services.

* Make sure the Ingress gateway works:

```
[~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo]kubectl get service traefik -n traefik
NAME      ...      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE

traefik   ...      localhost in     81:32720/TCP,443:32319/TCP   3h9m
```

* `ingress-url.sh` outputs the URL for the Ingress
  gateway.

* If you open
the Ingress URL, a static HTML page is shown which is served by the apache service.
This page has links to all other services.

* If it is not possible to access the Ingress or if the scripts show
  no valid URL, you can still use the script `ingress-forward.sh`. It
  creates a proxy to the Ingress on the local machine. The script
  prints out the URL for the proxy.

* You can execute `linkerd -n default check --proxy` to see whether
the Linkerd proxies actually work.


## Adding another Microservice

There is another microservice in the sub directory
`microservice-linkerd-bonus`. 
This microservice shows how you can add another microservice to the
system without sharing the build infrastructure. So for example you
can change the Java version or Spring Boot version of this
microservice without any impact on the other microservices.
To add the microservice to your system you
can do the following:

* Change to the directory `microservice-linkerd-bonus` and run `./mvnw clean
package` (macOS / Linux) or `mvnw.cmd clean package` (Windows) to
compile the Java 
code.

* Run `docker-build.sh` in the directory
`microservice-linkerd-bonus`. It builds the Docker images and uploads them into
the Kubernetes cluster.

* Google Cloud only: Upload the Docker images with `docker-push-gcp.sh`.

* Deploy the microservice with `kubectl apply -f bonus.yaml`.

* Google Cloud: Use `fix-bonus-gcp.sh` first and then deploy with
  `kubectl apply -f bonus-gcp.yaml`.

You can also download the images from Dockerhub with
`fix-bonus-github.sh` and `kubectl apply -f
bonus-dockerhub.yaml`. That way there is no need to build them
locally.

You can remove the microservice again with `kubectl delete -f bonus.yaml`.

#### Using the additonal microservice

The bonus microservice is not included in the static web page that
contains links to the other microservices. However, it can be accessed
via the Ingress gateway. `ingress-url.sh` outputs the
URL of the Ingress gateway. If the Ingress gateway's URL is
http://192.168.99.127:31380/, you can access the bonus microservice
at http://192.168.99.127:31380/bonus.

Note that the bonus microservice does not show any revenue for the
orders. This is because it requires a field `revenue` in the data the
order microservice provides. That field is currently not included in
the data structure. This shows that adding a new microservice might
require changes to a common data structure. Such changes might also
impact the other microservices.
However, the microservice still works even though the data is not
present.

## Prometheus

Linkerd comes with an installation of
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). It collects metrics from the
proxies of the services. This is the foundation for monitoring.

Enter `kubectl -n linkerd port-forward deployment/linkerd-prometheus
9090:9090` to create a proxy for the Prometheus service.

You can access Prometheus at http://localhost:9090/ then.
In the Google Cloud Shell you can use [Web
Preview](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview) to
open the URL from the shell in your local browser.

You can also use the shell script `monitoring-prometheus.sh`.

Metrics only make sense if there is load on the system. The shell
script `load.sh` uses the tool `curl` to request a certain URL 1,000
times. You can start one or multiple instances of this script with the
URL of the home page of the shipping microservice to create some
load on that service.

## Linkerd

Linkerd has its own dashboard that provides some information such as
the deployed resources, namespaces etc. You can use `linkerd
dashboard` to create a proxy to the dashboard and access it under the
provided URL. In particular "Top", "Tap", and "Routes" might be
interesting. Also the "Workload" includes some metrics and links to
Grafana.

You can get the data also via the command line with `linkerd
stat`. For example, `linkerd stat deploy` gives general metric for all
deployments. 

`linkerd routes`gives specific information about the metric for a
specific route between some deployments. For example, `linkerd routes
deploy/shipping --to service/order` shows the metrics for the
communication between the shipping and the order microservice for
polling new orders.

`linkerd top deploy` shows what is currently happening in the
Kubernetes cluster.

`linkerd tap deploy/order` shows which requests are currently
handled by the order microservice.

## Grafana

Prometheus has only very limited dashboards. Therefore linkerd comes
with an installation of [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) that provides
much better graphs and dashboards.

`linkerd dashboard` also provides access to the Grafana dashboard. So
you can use the URL provided by the command to access Grafana.

You can find information about the deployments in the Linkerd
Deployment dashboard.
You can choose one deployment and then click on the Grafana link for
it.


## Logging

Linkerd support logging of web traffic with its [tap
feature](https://linkerd.io/2/reference/cli/tap/). For the example,
you can use e.g. `linkerd tap deploy/order` to log any traffic to the
order microservice.

But Linkerd can only log the information from the HTTP requests in the
 logs. While this information is valuable, it is often not sufficient
 to investigate problems in the microservices. Therefore the
 microservices themselves must have some information, which can then
 be accessed via the Kubernetes infrastructure, for example.

## Security

Linkerd encrpyts the communication between the pods. You can verify
this with `linkerd edges deployment`. It should show that all
communication is secured. You can also use `linkerd tap deploy` to see
for each network communication whether it is encrypted with TLS or not.

## Fault Injection

Linkerd provides feature to split traffic between different
backends. That can be used to inject faults into a route between two
services. That makes it possible to test the system's resilience.
`fault-injection.yaml` adds an nginx instance to the system that will
always respond with an HTTP 500 error code. It also splits the traffic
between the original service and the nginx instance. That way, 50% of
all requests hit the nginx service and receive an error.  You can add
the configuration to the system with `kubectl apply -f
fault-injection.yaml` . If you make the shipping or invoicing
microservices poll new information from the order microservice now,
ends in an error in 50% of the cases.

`linkerd stat deploy` will say that the order deployment still works
flawlessly. However, `linkerd routes deploy/shipping --to
service/order` will show that some calls to the service fail. 
`linkerd routes deploy/shipping --to service/order -o wide` provides
even more information.

To remove the fault injection again, just use `kubectl delete -f
fault-injection.yaml`.

## Timeout

Linkerd adds timeouts to all services. However, the default timeout is
10 seconds and usually services will answer much quicker. If you use
`kubectl apply -f timeout.yaml` a timeout of 3ms will be set for GET
operations to `/order/feed` on the order microservice. You can now
create some load with `./load.sh "-X POST
http://localhost:80/shipping/poll"` . Quite a few of the calls will
fail now as the order microservice does not respond fast
enough. `linkerd routes deploy/shipping --to service/order -o wide`
provides more detailed statistics.

`kubectl delete -f timeout.yaml` removes the timeout.

## Retries

Use `kubectl apply -f failing-order-service.yaml` to deploy a version
of the order microservice that answers 50% of all requests with an
http status code of 500.  Use `failing-order-service-gcp.yaml` instead
of `failing-order-service.yaml` if you build and uploaded images to
Google Cloud. Use `failing-order-service-dockerhub.yaml` if you
haven't built the Docker container yourself.

If you access the order microservice's web UI or if you make shipping
and invoicing poll the order microservice, you will likely receive an
error. `linkerd routes deploy/shipping --to service/order` shows the
statistics about how many calls fail.

With `kubectl apply -f retry.yaml` you can make linkerd retry requests
to the order service. The configuration adds retries to the
communication between the microservices as well as the access through
the Ingress gateway. So polling and the web UI will both work again.

Linkerd uses a retry budget. It allows for at least 10 retries per
second but at max 20% additional load due to retries. That way retries
won't overload the system. Also retries are limit to HTTP GET
operations. GET is ensured to be idempotent so it is safe to retry
them. That is different for POSTs.

You can remove the retries with `kubectl delete -f retry.yaml`. The
failing microservice can be set to normal with `kubectl apply -f
microservices.yaml`.

## Clean Up

* To remove all services and deployments run `kubectl  delete -f microservices.yaml`:

```
[~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo] kubectl delete -f microservices.yaml
deployment.apps "catalog" deleted
deployment.apps "customer" deleted
deployment.apps "order" deleted
service "catalog" deleted
service "customer" deleted
service "order" deleted
virtualservice.networking.linkerd.io "customer" deleted
virtualservice.networking.linkerd.io "catalog" deleted
virtualservice.networking.linkerd.io "order" deleted
```

* Then remove the infrastructure - run `kubectl  delete -f
  infrastructure.yaml`:

```
[~/microservice-linkerd/microservice-linkerd-demo]kubectl  delete -f infrastructure.yaml
deployment.apps "apache" deleted
service "apache" deleted
gateway.networking.linkerd.io "microservice-gateway" deleted
virtualservice.networking.linkerd.io "apache" deleted
```

* To remove the Traefik ingress:  `helm uninstall --namespace=traefik traefik`
